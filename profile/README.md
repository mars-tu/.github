## Who are we?
Mechatronics and Robotics Society is TIET’s sole society dedicated entirely to the field of  robotics. The society is a blend of hardware and software intensive fields, and offers students the opportunity to work in an increasingly pertinent field within tech.
## Why Robotics?
A study conducted by London School of Economics estimated that the economic impact of robotics can
be roughly translated to 0.37% to 0.47% of the GDP. Several nations are already looking towards robotics as a tool to offset economic decline due to population decline by extensively making their industrial sectors more robot-intensive. From factories to space organizations, everyone is now slowly replacing humans with robots. From embedded systems to space exploration, we are now seeing a massive shift in society and we believe in readying the next generation to take on these new challenges and find a place in this society. Thus, a working knowledge of robots and their working is already a relevant skill set for engineers. MARS aims to facilitate expertise in the field by providing a comprehensive hands-on approach.
## Structure of the society
The society is segregated to three main departments: Artificial Intelligence in Robotics, Mechanical Modeling, Sensing and Actuation departments. Thus, MARS offers a distinct advantage as all branches have the opportunity to gain knowledge on not only work with their course related projects, but also gain knowledge beyond their textbooks. The three departments work in tandem with each other in delivering the final product.
## Our Vision
Besides imparting technical knowledge, we are focused on motivating students to innovate and discover new talents. To conceptualize and formulate robots is what we do, and to foster critical, analytical and innovative thinking is our aim.

The society actively aims and takes part in Robotics based competitions at the national and international levels like IRDC, IRC, and URC. We in MARS conduct different workshops (on Lego Kits, ROS, Arduino Uno, and Raspberry Pi kits etc), competitions, technical quizzes, and expert lectures on a regular basis. This provides all the members a great opportunity to learn and build futuristic things.

The vision of the society is in its motto i.e. We Create Dreams. Our society takes up projects which can be applied practically in real-time which gives a dream-like opportunity to be a part of something amazing and revolutionary.Here, everyone with their penchants come together to work towards creating something innovative and something which would make the robotics enthusiasts quench their thirst for knowledge and experience. We wish to leave our legacy as a team that creates robots as well as dreams and knowledge for people who we hope to continue and better our legacy.
